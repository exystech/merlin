.Sh NAME
.Nm init
.Nd system initialization
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm init
.Op Fl \-target Ns "=" Ns Ar init-target
.Op Fl \-chain Ns "=" Ns Ar path-or-uuid
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the first program run after system startup and is responsible for
initializing the operating system and starting the specified
.Ar init-target .
This is normally a login screen, a root shell, or a dedicated special purpose
program.
.Pp
The
.Xr kernel 7
starts the system in a temporary environment with a root filesystem
backed by system memory and extracts the
.Xr initrd 7
into it.  The kernel runs the
.Pa /sbin/init
program of the system memory root filesystem as the first process.  If the
system is bootable cdrom, then the initrd will be a fully functional system and
.Nm
will start a live environment or an operating system installer.  If the
system is installed on a harddisk, then the initrd is a minimal system made with
.Xr update-initrd 8
that will search for the actual root filesystem and chain init it.  The next
stage init will recognize it as the intended system and complete the system
startup.
.Ss Initialization Target
.Nm
first determines its target from the
.Fl \-target
option if specified or
.Pa /etc/init/target
otherwise. Supported targets are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "single-user" -compact -offset indent
.It chain
mount real root filesystem and run its
.Nm
.It multi-user
boot to
.Xr login 8
.It single-user
boot to root shell without password (not secure)
.It sysinstall
boot to operating system installer (not secure)
.It sysupgrade
boot to operating system upgrader (not secure)
.El
.Pp
It is a full system compromise if unauthenticated users are able to boot the
wrong target.  The kernel command line can specify the path to
.Nm
and its arguments.  Unprivileged users can change the kernel command line from
the bootloader command line if it hasn't been password protected.  Likewise
unprivileged users can use their own replacement bootloader by booting a
portable device under their control if the firmware configuration has not been
password protected.
.Ss Partition Creation
.Nm
will scan every block device for valid partition tables and create the
corresponding partition devices in
.Pa /dev .
.Ss Chain Initialization
The chain target triggers a search for the root filesystem.  The
.Fl \-chain Ns "=" Ns Ar path-or-uuid
option implies
.Fl \-target Ns "=" Ns chain
if it is not set and specifies the method to locate the root filesystem.  The
.Ar path-or-uuid
value is either a path to a directory, in which case it is used as the root
filesystem, or a file that contains a uuid of the root filesystem, or it can be
a valid uuid of the intended root filesystem.  If the
.Fl \-chain
option is not specified, the root filesystem of
.Pa /etc/fstab
is used as described in
.Xr fstab 5 .
.Pp
Every block device and partition is scanned to determine if it is the filesystem
by matching the desired uuid.  The root filesystem is checked for consistency
and mounted at
.Pa /tmp/fs.XXXXXX
and the
.Pa /dev
filesystem directory is bound at
.Pa /tmp/fs.XXXXXX/dev .
.Pp
Finally the
.Pa /sbin/init
program of the target root filesystem is run inside a chroot.
.Ss Configuration
Once the
.Nm
of the real root filesystem runs, it will process basic configuration files and
apply them:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/videomode" -compact -offset indent
.It Pa /etc/hostname
set hostname (see
.Xr hostname 5 )
.It Pa /etc/kblayout
set keyboard layout (see
.Xr kblayout 5 )
.It Pa /etc/videomode
set graphics resolution (see
.Xr videomode 5 )
.El
.Ss Session
Finally
.Nm
will start the target program according to its initialization target.  This will
be a login screen, a root shell, or something else.  If the process exits
abnormally
.Nm
will automatically restart it.
.Nm
will exit with the same exit status as the process if it exits
normally.  The kernel decides whether to power off, reboot or halt based on this
exit status.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
sets the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "INIT_PID"
.It Ev HOME
root's home directory
.It Ev INIT_PID
.Nm Ns 's
process id
.It Ev LOGNAME
root
.It Ev PATH
.Pa /bin:/sbin
.It Ev SHELL
root's shell
.It Ev TERM
sortix
.It Ev USER
root
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/init/target" -compact
.It Pa /etc/init/target
default initialization target
.It Pa /etc/fstab
filesystem table (see
.Xr fstab 5 )
.It Pa /etc/hostname
hostname (see
.Xr hostname 5 )
.It Pa /etc/kblayout
keyboard layout (see
.Xr kblayout 5 )
.It Pa /etc/videomode
graphics resolution (see
.Xr videomode 5 )
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits 0 if the kernel should power off, exits 1 if the kernel should reboot, or
exits 2 if the boot failed and the kernel should halt.  Any other exit by the
initial
.Nm
will trigger a kernel panic.
.Nm
exits with the same exit status as its target session if it terminates normally.
