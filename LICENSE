See the individual files for copyright notices and license terms.

The above license covers works original to the Sortix project. Sortix contains
derivative works from other projects that remain under their original licenses.
Such files contain copyright notices detailing their origin and license. If a
file has no copyright statement and is original to the Sortix project, the above
license applies. The Sortix base system contains only permissively licensed free
software. There is no code under the GNU GPL or variants.

The Sortix ports collection contains third party code which is licensed
independently of the Sortix base systems. Such code may have licenses that
impose restrictions, such as requiring also providing the corresponding source
code when providing compiled program code to others.

Official Sortix releases contain the binary packages from the ports collection
and thus may contain code whose licenses impose restrictions. Official Sortix
releases are intended to be usable for any purpose, with or without fee, and
redistributable as long as the corresponding ports source code is also provided.

The Sortix math library (libm) is licensed as described in the libm/LEGAL file.
