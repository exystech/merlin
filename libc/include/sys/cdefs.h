 * Compatibility macros to advertise to ports when features become available.
 * These macros are only for things that are not trivial to detect from a C
 * source file (such as by a standard macro).
 *
 * The feature foo should initially have an undef preprocessor statement of the
 * macro __SORTIX_HAS_FOO__ (or something like that). It should carry a TODO
 * comment stating:
 *
 * - What the feature is and when the macro should become defined.
 * - Which ports (if any) rely on this macro and will use the feature whenever
 *   the macro is defined.
 * - That the macro should be removed when the specific ports have been updated
 *   to no longer rely on the macro. If no ports used the feature in the first
 *   place, it should say to remove the macro when the feature is implemented.
 *
 * The undef statement should become a define statement when the feature is
 * implemented. As the each port is updated after that, the feature should
 * become unconditionally used in the port, and the port is removed from the
 * list here. Finally, when the list is empty, the macro is removed entirely.
 *
 * For instance, the TODO statement for the feature foo with the undef'd macro
 * __SORTIX_HAS_FOO__ might say:
 *
 *   "Define when foo is implemented. Remove when libbar, libqux, and libbaz are
 *    updated to not rely on this macro."
 *
 * Should a port become broken if a macro is defined here, the port should be
 * fixed (by either fixing it or disabling the feature in the port regardless
 * of the macro) before the macro is officially enabled here.
