.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
manages the build of a
.Xr port 5
of software for this operating system by downloading the source code, applying
the patches, building the port, and installing the binary package.
Many of the options are forwarded to the low-level
.Xr tix-build 8
which performs the build once the source code has been prepared.
.Nm
is usually invoked through
.Xr development 7
for the official ports.
.Pp
The mandatory
.Ar port
argument is the directory where the port's source code will be placed and the
.Xr port 5
file is found by adding
.Pa .port
to this path.
The downloaded upstream releases are placed in the created
.Pa port.mirror
cache directory, the source code is extracted in the
.Ar port
directory with the
.Pa port.patch ,
.Pa port.execpatch ,
and
.Pa port.rmpatch
patches applied if they exist, and the
.Pa port.version
stamp file is created to avoid reextracting the port if the right version is
already extracted.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "12345678"
.It Fl \-build Ns = Ns Ar triplet
The platform
.Ar triplet
for the machine the port is built on.
(Default: Automatically detected.)
.It Fl \-cache-package
Skip the build if the binary package already exists and is the right version.
.It Fl \-collection Ns = Ns Ar collection
Install the binary package into this
.Ar collection
created with
.Xr tix-collection 8 .
(Default:
.Fl \-sysroot
plus
.Fl \-prefix )
.It Fl \-destination Ns = Ns Ar directory
The binary package is placed inside this
.Ar directory .
.It Fl \-end Ns = Ns Ar step
Stop the build after this
.Ar step :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "clean, pre-clean" -compact
.It start
The start step before anything has happened.
.It download
Download the source code.
.It extract
Extract the source code and apply patches.
.It tix-build-start
The start step in
.Xr tix-build 8 .
.It clean, pre-clean
Clean the source directory before the build.
.It configure
Configure the port.
.It build
Build the port.
.It install
Install the port into the
.Ev DESTDIR .
.It post-install
Run the post-installation script.
.It post-clean
Clean the source code after the port.
.It package
Create the binary package.
.It tix-build-end
The end step in
.Xr tix-build 8 .
.It strip
Strip the executables in the binary package.
.It diff
Regenerate the patches if in development.
.It tix-install
Install the binary package.
.It end
The end step after everything has happened.
(Default)
.El
.It Fl \-exec-prefix Ns = Ns Ar prefix
The
.Ar prefix
where architecture dependent files are installed.
(Default:
.Fl \-prefix )
.It Fl \-generation Ns = Ns Ar generation
Create a binary package in the format of this tix generation
.Ar level .
(Default: 2)
.It Fl \-host Ns = Ns Ar triplet
The platform
.Ar triplet
for the machine the port will run on.
(Default:
.Fl \-build )
.It Fl \-make Ns = Ns Ar path
Which
.Xr make 1
to use.
(Default:
.Ev MAKE
if set and otherwise
.Xr make 1 )
.It Fl \-makeflags Ns = Ns Ar makeflags
Override the
.Ev MAKEFLAGS
variable inherited by make.
.It Fl \-prefix Ns = Ns Ar prefix
Build the port into this
.Ar prefix .
(Default: The empty prefix designating the root directory)
.It Fl \-source-port Ns = Ns Ar source-port
The source code for the
.Sy SOURCE_PORT
per
.Xr port 5
will be placed in the
.Ar source-port
directory along with the mirror and version file where the source port's file is
found by adding
.Pa .port
to this path.
(Default: ../$SOURCE_PORT/$SOURCE_PORT)
.It Fl \-start Ns = Ns Ar step
Start the build at this step (see
.Fl \-end ) .
(Default:
.Sy start )
.It Fl \-sysroot Ns = Ns Ar directory
The system root to use while building and installing the port.
The toolchain is wrapped to transparently use this sysroot during the build.
.It Fl \-tar Ns = Ns Ar path
Which
.Xr tar 1
to use during the build.
(Default:
.Xr tar 1 )
.It Fl \-target Ns = Ns Ar triplet
The port's outputs targets this platform
.Ar triplet .
(Default:
.Fl \-host )
.It Fl \-tmp Ns = Ns Ar directory
Place temporary files in this
.Ar directory .
(Default:
.Ev TMPDIR
if set otherwise
.Pa /tmp )
.It Fl \-mirror Ns = Ns Ar url
First attempt to download the upstream releases from the port's source code
mirror at
.Ar url
before attempting the upstream site.
The files are copied from the filesystem if the
.Ar url
has no schema.
.It Fl \-mirror-directory Ns = Ns Ar directory
Place the downloaded upstream releases in this
.Ar directory
in the layout that can be used as a mirror for the
.Fl \-mirror
option.
(Default:
.Ar port Ns Pa .mirror )
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
will exit 0 on success and non-zero otherwise.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A
.Xr port 5
called
.Pa example.port
with optional patches
.Pa example.patch ,
.Pa example.execpatch ,
and
.Pa example.rmpatch
can be downloaded, extracted, patched, built and installed into the
.Pa /local
prefix for non-system software by running:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkdir -p /local # if not already done
tix-collection /local create # if not already done
tix-port --prefix=/local example
.Ed
.Pp
This command makes a
.Pa example
directory with the patched source code, a
.Pa example.version
version stamp file to avoid unnecessary reextractions, a
.Pa example.mirror
cache directory with the downloaded upstream release, and the
.Pa example.tix.tar.xz
binary package, which is installed into
.Pa /local .
The
.Fl \-end=strip
option can be used to just get the binary package (and not install it)
by stopping after the binary package has been stripped.
