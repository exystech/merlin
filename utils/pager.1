.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays the input one page at a time.
The input is the concatenation of the input files, or the standard input if no
files were specified and the standard input is not a terminal.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "12345678"
.It Fl R
Output only escape sequences that change font properties such as color and
boldness.
.It Fl r
Causes raw control characters to be dumped directly onto the terminal.
Usage of this option may cause output to be misleading for suspicious files, as
the escape codes in the file are rendered and can be used to hide parts of the
input.
Avoid the -r option if you want to see the actual bytes in the file, or use -R
to show only selected escape codes.
