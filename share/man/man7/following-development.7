.Sh DESCRIPTION
This document is a list of changes that affect the ability to build and run the
latest Sortix source code, when doing native
.Xr development 7
or
.Xr cross-development 7 .
The list is in reverse chronological order.
The system has policies that handle incompatible changes gracefully.
.Pp
If you are updating to new source code, be sure you are reading the new version
of this document, rather than an old copy installed on the system or on an
online manual page viewer.
To view the new version from the command line:
.Bd -literal
    cd /src  # system source code location
    man share/man/man7/following-development.7
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Xr sysmerge 8
and
.Xr sysupgrade 8
programs automatically handle compatibility issues when upgrading an existing
system to a new build.
They can handle incompatible ABI changes and automatically fix configuration
files and other issues.
.Pp
When building the system from source code, you must have the latest build tools
installed as detailed in
.Xr development 7
and
.Xr cross-development 7 .
After upgrading to newer source code, you must first install the new build tools
before building.
If this is needed, there will be a notice in this document.
Build tools will likely complain about missing options or invalid parameters if
they are not up to date.
Automatic build scripts should use the
.Sy install-build-tools
target provided by the root makefile.
.Pp
Changes to the source code may rely on the newest build tools, but the build
tools must retain the ability to build all the way back to the latest stable
release.
The build tools of release N+1 must be able to build release N.
The build tools must be portable to the latest stable release and the supported
.Xr cross-development 7
systems.
If a build tool needs an incompatible change, there must be added a way to opt
into the new behavior, and the build system must use that option and not use the
old behavior any more.
This forward compatibility will allow the removal of the old behavior after the
next release.
Temporary compatibility must be mentioned with a condition for when it can be
removed and it must have instructions for what needs to be done.
Use a comment in the format
"TODO: After
.\" Line break so this occurrence doesn't make a false positive when I grep.
releasing Sortix x.y, foo." to allow the maintainer to easily
.Xr grep 1
for it after a release.
.Sh CHANGES
.Ss Add socket(2)
The
.Pa /dev/net
virtual filesystem for socket creation has been removed in favor of adding an
actual
.Xr socket 2
system call.
This is a major incompatible ABI change.
Only Unix sockets were exposed this way.
In the base system,
.Xr sf 1
is the only program with Unix socket capabilities.
Ports using Unix sockets must be updated.
Otherwise the system is compatible except accessing Unix sockets fails with
.Er ENOENT .
.Ss Add split packages and cross-bootstrapping support to tix-build(8)
.Xr tix-build 8
has gained a number of features that will soon be required in order to build
certain ports.
In particular, it now supports the
.Sy pkg.use-bootstrap ,
.Sy pkg.source-package ,
and
.Sy pkg.alias-of
variables; bugs in the
.Sy pkg.subdir
variable have been fixed; and a
.Fl \-source-directory
option has been added.
.Xr tix-build 8
must be upgraded before building ports using any of those features.
.Bd -literal
    cd /src/tix &&
    make clean &&
    make install
.Ed
.Pp
If not developing natively, set
.Ev PREFIX
to the desired location.
.Pp
If the new program isn't used, ports may fail to build due to local software not
being the exact same version
.Sy ( pkg.use-bootstrap ) ,
clean or post-install in the wrong subdirectory
.Sy ( pkg.subdir) ,
the
.Fl \-source-directory
option not being recognized or failing to locate the source code
.Sy ( pkg.source-package) ,
stopping because
.Sy pkg.build-system
isn't set
.Sy ( pkg.alias-of) ,
or other mysterious circumstances.
.Ss Add German keyboard layout
The
.Xr kblayout-compiler 1
build tool has gained support for modifier combinations used by the German
keyboard layout, and the new German keyboard layout relies on this.
.Xr kblayout-compiler 1
must be upgraded before building the system.
.Bd -literal
    cd /src/kblayout-compiler &&
    make clean &&
    make install
.Ed
.Pp
If not developing natively, set
.Ev PREFIX
to the desired location.
.Pp
If the new program isn't used, the build will still complete successfully but an
incorrect German keyboard layout will be installed.
.Ss Seed kernel entropy with randomness from the previous boot
Entropy from the previous boot is now stored in
.Pa /boot/random.seed .
The bootloader is supposed to load this file as a multiboot module with the
command line option
.Fl \-random-seed .
The kernel will issue a security warning if it was booted without a random seed,
unless the kernel command line contains
.Fl \-no-random-seed .
The GRUB port has been updated with an improved
.Pa /etc/grub.d/10_sortix
script that will automatically emit the appropriate GRUB commands.
.Pp
Users using the included GRUB will need to update to the latest GRUB port
and then run
.Xr update-initrd 8
to regenerate
.Pa /etc/grub/grub.cfg .
All of this will be handled automatically if upgrading with
.Xr sysupgrade 8
and the new build contains the new GRUB, or if upgrading with
.Xr sysmerge 8
and the source system root contains the new GRUB.
.Pp
Users not using the included GRUB, but still using GRUB from another
installation, will need to reconfigure that bootloader installation.
In the boot commands of this system, add after the initrd load:
.Bd -literal
    module /boot/random.seed --random-seed
.Ed
.Pp
If the GRUB port is installed, but not used, then if that port is updated with
.Xr sysupgrade 8
or
.Xr sysmerge 8
or manually, the
.Pa /etc/grub.d/10_sortix
script can be invoked, which will generate a
.Pa /etc/grub.d/10_sortix.cache
fragment that can be spliced into the configuration of another GRUB
installation.
.Pp
Users not using GRUB will need to configure their bootloader
to load
.Pa /boot/random.seed
appropriately.
.Pp
.Xr sysmerge 8
and
.Xr sysupgrade 8
will automatically create
.Pa /boot/random.seed
if it doesn't exist.
If using neither to upgrade, manually create that file owned by user root and
group root with mode 600 containing 256 bytes of entropy.
.Ss Modernize carray(1) and fix missing allocation checks
The
.Xr carray 1
build tool has gained the
.Fl EGHot
options and the build system now relies on this.
.Xr carray 1
must be upgraded before building the system.
.Bd -literal
    cd /src/carray &&
    make clean &&
    make install
.Ed
.Pp
If not developing natively, set
.Ev PREFIX
to the desired location.
.Ss Remove compatibility with Sortix 0.9
Sortix 1.0 has been released.
The build tools are no longer capable of building anything prior to the Sortix
1.0 release.
