.Sh NAME
.Nm port
.Nd port build instructions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /src/ports/example/example.port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The .port file format defines the build instructions for a piece of software
ported to this operating system as a package.
.Pp
This manual documents the file format and
.Xr porting 7
is the guide on how to author a port.
.Pp
A port called
.Sy example
consists of the following adjacent files:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "example.execpatch" -compact
.It Pa example.port
build instructions and meta information.
.It Pa example.patch
optional
.Xr patch 1
applied to the upstream release.
.It Pa example.execpatch
optional
.Xr tix-execpatch 8
changing the executable bit on files.
.It Pa example.rmpatch
optional
.Xr tix-rmpatch 8
deleting files from the upstream release.
.El
.Pp
The upstream release archive is downloaded and extracted into the
.Pa example
directory with each kind of patches applied, which is used as the working
directory when building the port.
Ports are extracted with read-only files and writable directories by default.
The
.Pa example.version
file is created with the version number and checksums of the above files.
.Pp
If the port is placed in the
.Pa /src/ports/example/
directory then it's built as part of the operating system.
The port can be built directly using
.Xr tix-port 8
which handles downloading and patching the source code, building the port,
and installing the binary package.
.Pp
The .port files define the meta information using a subset of the
.Xr sh 1
language syntax for variable assignments as parsed by
.Xr tix-vars 8 .
Basic variable substitutions, escape sequences, single quotes, double quotes,
and comments are supported.
.Pp
The variables are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "12345678"
.It Sy ALIAS_OF
Declares this port to be an empty port that's an alias for the named port.
.It Sy ARCHIVE
Extract the upstream archive by this file name if set,
usually
.Sy $DISTNAME.$COMPRESSION
where
$COMPRESSION
is normally tar.xz or the appropriate file extension.
.It Sy ARCHIVE_2
A second
.Sy ARCHIVE
if set with its own set of similar variables.
.It Sy BUILD_LIBRARIES
Space delimited list of libraries (ports) linked with.
Optional dependencies are suffixed with a question mark
.Sq "?" .
.It Sy BUILD_PROGRAMS
Space delimited list of programs (ports) needed to build this port.
Optional dependencies are suffixed with a question mark
.Sq "?" .
.It Sy BUILD_SYSTEM
The build system used by this port:
.Bl -tag -width "configure"
.It Sy configure
A
.Pa ./configure
script following the GNU coding conventions communicated with using standard
command line options and standard environment variables.
.It Sy makefile
A
.Pa Makefile
using the below set of conventional environment variables.
.El
.It Sy CONFIGURE
The path to the configure script relative to the source directory.
(Default:
.Pa ./configure )
.It Sy CONFIGURE_ARGS
Additional command line arguments passed to configure.
.It Sy CONFIGURE_USE_BUILD_DIRECTORY Ns = Ns Oo Sy false "|" true Oc
Whether to use a temporary working directory when building the port where the
object files will be placed instead of inside the source directory.
(Default:
.Sy false )
.It Sy CONFIGURE_VARS
Additional environment variable assignments while configure is run.
.It Sy CONFIGURE_WITH_BUILD_SYSROOT Ns = Ns Oo Sy false "|" true Oc
Whether to tell configure where the system root is located during the build
using the
.Fl \-with-build-sysroot
option.
(Default:
.Sy false )
.It Sy CONFIGURE_WITH_SYSROOT Ns = Ns Oo Sy false "|" true Oc
Whether to tell configure where the system root is located at runtime using the
.Fl \-with-sysroot
option.
(Default:
.Sy false )
.It Sy CONFIGURE_WITH_SYSROOT_LD_BUG Ns = Ns Oo Sy false "|" true Oc
Whether the
.Fl \-with-sysroot
option doesn't understand the empty string as meaning no system root will be
used at runtime and
.Fl \-with-sysroot Ns = Ns /
should be used instead.
(Default:
.Sy false )
.It Sy COMPRESSION Ns = Ns Oo Sy tar "|" tar.gz "|" tar.bz2 "|" tar.xz Oc
The file extension of
.Sy ARCHIVE
including the compression format.
.It Sy COMPRESSION_2 Ns = Ns Oo Sy tar "|" tar.gz "|" tar.bz2 "|" tar.xz Oc
For
.Sy ARCHIVE_2 .
.It Sy DEVELOPMENT Ns = Ns Oo Sy false "|" true Oc
Whether the port is in the development workflow per
.Xr porting 7 .
(Default:
.Sy false )
.Pp
If
.Sy false ,
the port is extracted with read-only files and writable directories.
The port's source directory is considered a cache that can be safely deleted
without data loss e.g. whenever the meta information or the patches change.
.Pp
If
.Sy true ,
any old non-development extraction is deleted, and the archive is instead
extracted with writable permissions in development mode.
The port's source directory contains an in-progress port that's considered
valuable and will not be deleted under any circumstances as long as the port
remains in development mode.
If the port builds successfully, then the patches are regenerated by diffing the
upstream release with the source directory.
.It Sy DIRTY_FILE

.Sy config.log ,
.Sy Makefile ,
and
.Sy makefile )

number matched in the first subexpression.

and
.Sy VERSION_REGEX )
.It Sy LICENSE
Abbreviation of the license the port is released under.
.It Sy LOCATION_INDEPENDENT Ns = Ns Oo Sy false "|" true Oc
Whether binary packages are location independent, i.e. can be installed in
another prefix than one supplied at build time.
(Default:
.Sy false )
.It Sy MAKE

.It Sy MAKE_ARGS
Additional arguments passed to make.
.It Sy MAKE_BUILD_TARGET
Build the port by making this target.
(Default:
.Sy all )
.It Sy MAKE_CLEAN_TARGET
Clean the port by making this target.
(Default:
.Sy distclean
if
.Sy BUILD_SYSTEM=configure
and
.Sy clean
otherwise)
.It Sy MAKE_IGNORE_CLEAN_FAILURE Ns = Ns Oo Sy false "|" true Oc
Whether to silently ignore if cleaning the port failed.
(Default:
.Sy true )
.It Sy MAKE_INSTALL_TARGET

.Ev DESTDIR
environment variable set to a temporary secondary prefix for the purpose of
installation-time packaging.
(Default:
.Sy install )
.It Sy MAKE_VARS
Additional environment variable assignments while make is run.
.It Sy NAME
The name of the port.
.It Sy NEED_WRITABLE Ns = Ns Oo Sy false "|" true Oc

.It Sy UPSTREAM_ARCHIVE
The filename of the upstream release on
.Sy UPSTREAM_SITE ,
usually

Bootstrap a new version of this port by first building a local version installed
into a temporary directory in the

and then use it to build the final version.
(Default:
.Sy false )
.Pp
This functionality is useful when e.g. cross-compiling a port requires the same
version of the port to already be locally installed.
The bootstrap phase uses its own set of variables prefixed with
.Sy BOOTSTRAP_

.El

.Sy VERSION_MINOR ,
and
.Sy VERSION_PATCH
and define
.Sy VERSION
as
.Sy $VERSION_MAJOR.$VERSION_MINOR.$VERSION_PATCH .
.It Sy VERSION_2
For
.Sy ARCHIVE_2 .
.It Sy VERSION_REGEX
