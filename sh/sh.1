.Sh NAME
.Nm sh
.Nd shell command interpreter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sh
.Op Fl ceils
.Op Ar script Oo argument ... Oc
.Nm sortix-sh
.Op Fl ceils
.Op Ar script Oo argument ... Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the command line interpreter for the shell language.
It reads and executes commands from the standard input or the
.Ar script
file if specified.
.Nm
is interactive if the standard input is a terminal and no
.Ar script
file was specified.
.Pp
The standard shell
.Nm sortix-sh
is currently primitive and cannot execute most scripts.
.Nm sh
is currently a thin wrapper that detects non-interactive use and invokes a
better shell instead, named in the
.Ev SORTIX_SH_BACKEND
environment variable if set, or named in
.Xr proper-sh 5
if it exists, and otherwise
.Xr dash 1
is invoked.
.Pp
The options can be unset by prefixing them with a plus
.Sq +
instead of a dash
.Sq - .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "12345678"
.It Fl c
The
.Ar script
argument contains the script's text instead of a path to the script file.
.It Fl e
Exit if any command exit non-zero.
.It Fl i
Interactively read and execute commands.
.It Fl l
The shell is a login shell.
Interactive shells run the
.Xr profile 5
script on startup instead of the
.Xr shrc
script.
This option is set if the shell is invoked by a name starting with a dash
.Sq - .
.It Fl s
Read commands from the standard input (the default).
This option can be combined with the
.Fl c
option to execute the script text in the
.Ar script
argument before reading normally from the standard input
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
uses environment these variables:
.Bl -tag -width "HISTFILE"
.It Ev ENV
File to execute on non-login interactive startup instead of
.Pa ~/.shrc
per
.Xr shrc 5 .
This variable is subject to path expansion.
.It Ev HISTFILE
Save the shell history in this file.
The default is
.Pa ~/.sh_history .
.It Ev HISTSIZE
Maximum number of commands in the saved shell history.
The default is 500.

.It Ev PWD

.It Ev SHELL

.It Ev SHLVL
Depth of recursive shell sessions.
The outermost interactive shell (depth 1) will currently refuse to exit on an
end-of-file condition (^D) when on the
.Pa /dev/tty1
terminal to avoid accidentally powering off the machine.
.It Ev SORTIX_SH_BACKEND
Name of a better shell to use for non-interactive use per
.Xr proper-sh 5 .
This variable takes precedence over
.Pa /etc/proper-sh .
.El

.Bl -tag -width "/etc/proper-sh" -compact

.Xr profile 5

.It Pa ~/.sh_history

This location is controlled by the
.Ev HISTFILE
environment variable.
.It Pa ~/.shrc , /etc/shrc , /etc/default/shrc
