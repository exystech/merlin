.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sh

.Nm sortix-sh
.Op Fl ceis
.Op Ar script Oo argument ... Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the command line interpreter for the shell language.
It reads and executes commands from the standard input or the
.Ar script
file if specified.
.Nm
is interactive if the standard input is a terminal and no
.Ar script
file was specified.
.Pp
The standard shell
.Nm sortix-sh
is currently primitive and cannot execute most scripts.
.Nm sh
is currently a thin wrapper that detects non-interactive use and invokes a
better shell instead, named in the
.Ev SORTIX_SH_BACKEND
environment variable if set, or named in
.Xr proper-sh 5
if it exists, and otherwise
.Xr dash 1
is invoked.
.Pp
The options can be unset by prefixing them with a plus
.Sq +
instead of a dash
.Sq - .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "12345678"
.It Fl c
The
.Ar script
argument contains the script's text instead of a path to the script file.
.It Fl e
Exit if any command exit non-zero.
.It Fl i
Interactively read and execute commands.
.It Fl s
Read commands from the standard input (the default).
This option can be combined with the
.Fl c
option to execute the script text in the
.Ar script
argument before reading normally from the standard input
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT

.Pa /dev/tty1
terminal to avoid accidentally powering off the machine.
.It Ev SORTIX_SH_BACKEND

.El

.It Pa /etc/proper-sh
Name of a better shell to use for non-interactive use per
