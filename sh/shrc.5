.Dt SHRC 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm shrc
.Nd login shell startup
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm $ENV
.Nm ~/.shrc
.Nm /etc/shrc
.Nm /etc/default/shrc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Interactive non-login shell sessions in
.Xr sh 1
execute the commands in the
.Nm
script upon startup, using the
.Pa ENV
environment variable with path expansion if set, and otherwise searching for the
user's script at
.Pa ~/.shrc ,
any system administrator provided script at
.Pa /etc/shrc ,
or any operating system provided script at
.Pa /etc/default/shrc ,
whichever exists first.
.Pp
The
.Xr profile 5
script is run instead in interactive login shell sessions.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "ENV"
.It Ev ENV
File to execute on non-login interactive startup instead of searching the
standard paths for the
.Nm
script.
This variable is subject to path expansion.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/default/shrc" -compact
.It Pa ~/.shrc
The user's
.Nm
script.
.It Pa /etc/shrc

.Nm
script.
.It Pa /etc/default/shrc
The operating system provided

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dash 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr shrc 5
.Sh CAVEATS
.Xr dash
does not use the
.Nm
script, but instead only uses the
.Ev ENV
environment variable.
To invoke the
.Nm
script portably across all standard shells upon startup of non-interactive login
sells, set the
.Ev ENV
variable to the user's
.Nm
script per the example in
.Xr profile 5 .
.Sh BUGS
.Xr sh 1
is currently primitive and cannot execute most scripts.
Beware of sharing the
.Nm
script between it and other shells such as
.Xr dash 1 .
