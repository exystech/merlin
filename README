The Sortix Operating System
===========================

Sortix is a small Unix-like operating system developed since 2011 with emphasis
on cleaning up traditional Unix design mistakes while retaining compatibility
with third party software. Much third party software has been ported to Sortix
and the system is now self-building. The Sortix kernel, standard libraries, and
most utilities were written entirely from scratch.

System Requirements
-------------------

Sortix has low system requirements. It also works well under virtual machines
such as VirtualBox and Qemu - however Bochs is not officially supported:

* A 32-bit x86 (with SSE) or 64-bit x86_64 CPU.
* A few dozen megabytes of RAM - or if you are using a cdrom release with ports
  then you likely need at least twice the size of the cdrom image.
* A harddisk or cdrom drive or support for booting from USB.
* A multiboot compliant bootloader if booting from harddisk.
* A Parallel ATA harddisk, if you wish to access it from Sortix. SATA is not
  supported yet.

Documentation
-------------

You can find the documentation for Sortix use and development at your local
documentation mirror, for instance:

  The documentation directory in a Sortix system:
  /share/doc

  The doc directory inside the Sortix source repository:
  doc/

  The official Sortix website:

Building Sortix
---------------

If you wish to build Sortix under Sortix itself, please consult the user guide:
