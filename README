The Sortix Operating System
===========================
Sortix is a hobby operating system. It was originally created as a tool to learn
more about kernel and operating system design and implementation. Today is
transforming into a real operating system. The standard library and kernel is
rich enough that some third party software can and has been ported to Sortix.
However, the system remains quite limited as of this writing. Many features are
missing such as proper filesystem support, bitmap graphics, and networking.
Proper filesystem support is currently being added.

The system aims to be an Unix-clone and is heavily based on POSIX. However, I've
drawn much inspiration from systems such as Plan 9, GNU/Hurd and MINIX. Indeed,
I plan to construct a micro-kernel with user-space filesystems, per-process
namespaces, replacing many system calls with filesystem nodes, and other
exciting features.

System Requirements
-------------------
Sortix has very low system requirements. It also works well under virtual
machines such as VirtualBox and Qemu.

* A 32-bit x86 or 64-bit x86_64 CPU.
* A dozen megabyte RAM.
* A harddisk or cdrom drive or support for booting from USB.
* A multiboot compliant bootloader if booting from harddisk.
* A Parallel ATA harddisk, if you wish to access it from Sortix. SATA is not
  supported yet.

Features
--------
The current development version of Sortix offers a traditional multi-process
protected environment with round-robin scheduling. A quick and dirty shell is
able to execute programs in foreground or background mode, handle IO redirection
and piping the standard output of a process into the standard input of another.
A real shell will be added as the system matures and I get around to finish the
work in progress shell.

A number of standard utilities are present such as cat, head, tail, clear, cp,
column, kill, ls, rm, pwd, uname, echo, and uptime. There is even a number of 
non-standard utilities such as calc, help, init, kernelinfo, memstat, and pager.
This collection of utilities will continue to grow as it matures and third party
software is ported. I've currently had some luck porting gzip and parts of
binutils.

A number of small games is present and uses the VGA textmode to render ASCII
graphics. Notably you can play two-player Pong, or single-player Snake, or the
nice and turing-complete Conway's Game of Life. These are probably the main
attraction of the system for non-technical people.

The Sortix kernel has very basic filesystem support. The root filesystem / is
simply a single-directory RAM filesystem. The init ramdisk is mounted read-only
on /bin and various devices are accessable through the /dev filesystem. A lot of
work is currently going into implementing a fully-working kernel virtual file
system able to outsource filesystem requests to user-space servers. Once this is
completed we will be able to shape Sortix into a real microkernel based system.

Job control and Unix signals is not fully or correctly implemented. This means
that sequences such as Ctrl-C (SIGINT) not always works correctly. This will
be implemented soon enough (depends partially on VFS; see above).

There currently is no concept of users in the system (only the root user
exists). I decided to delay making a multi-user system until the base system is
in place. Note that there is only a single terminal - even though the system is
a multi-process system, there is only a single /dev/vga and there is no
framework in place for sharing it.

Technical details
----------------
The system is mostly coded in C++, but also contains a few files in C. However,
the user-land experiences a normal C programming interface as per POSIX.
Executable files natively uses the ELF format used on GNU/Linux and other
systems. There is no shared library support yet, but it'll be possible when I
get around to implement copy-on-write memory, mmap(2) and swapping to disk.
