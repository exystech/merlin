The Sortix Operating System
===========================

Sortix is a small self-hosting Unix-like operating system developed since 2011
aiming to be a clean and modern POSIX implementation. There's a lot of technical
debt that needs to be paid, but it's getting better. Traditional design mistakes
are avoided or aggressively deprecated by updating the base system and ports as
needed. The Sortix kernel, standard libraries, and most utilities were written
entirely from scratch. The system is halfway through becoming multi-user and
while security vulnerabilities are recognized as bugs, it should be considered
insecure at this time.

System Requirements
-------------------

Sortix has low system requirements. It also works well under virtual machines
such as VirtualBox and Qemu:

* A 32-bit x86 (with SSE) or 64-bit x86_64 CPU.
* A few dozen megabytes of RAM - or if you are using a cdrom release with ports
  then you likely need at least twice the size of the cdrom image.
* A harddisk or cdrom drive or support for booting from USB.
* A multiboot compliant bootloader if booting from harddisk.
* A Parallel ATA harddisk, if you wish to access it from Sortix. The AHCI driver
  has not been merged yet.

Documentation
-------------

You can find the documentation for Sortix use and development at your local
documentation mirror, for instance:
