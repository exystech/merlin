The Sortix Operating System
===========================

Sortix is a small self-hosting operating-system aiming to be a clean and modern
POSIX implementation.  It is a hobbyist operating system written from scratch
with its own base system, including kernel and standard library, as well as
ports of third party software.  It has a straightforward installer and is can be
developed under itself.  Releases come with the source code in /src, ready for
tinkering.

It has been in development since 2011 by a single developer and contributors.
Though the system is stable and capable right now, it is still early in
development, and a number of crucial features haven't been made yet.  Releases
are made yearly and future releases will add features such as networking, SMP,
and USB that were skipped in favor of becoming self-hosting now.

Documentation
-------------

The system is documented as manual pages.  Introductory system usage is covered
in the user-guide(7) manual page.
